## Tutorial 1 - NBA Combine data
Analyse an NBA Combine dataset using ANOVA and Mixed Models using SAS On Demand. 
All the information needed for this tutorial is in the nba_combine folder. It can be downloaded quickly using this link: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tom-sawczuk/sas_ondemand/tree/main/nba_combine

### 1a - Null model and One Way ANOVA
*Start analysing the data by producing a null (intercept only) model and One Way ANOVA.*

### 1b - Two Way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Model
*Incorporate two independent variables using both the Two Way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Model approaches*

### 1c - Comparing fixed and random effects
*Investigate and understand the difference between fixed and random effects*

### 1d - Interpreting the model
*Interpret the output of the Linear Mixed Model*

## Tutorial 2 - Athlete Monitoring data
Analyse an athlete monitoring dataset using Linear Mixed Models. 
All the information needed for this tutorial is in the athlete_monitoring folder. It can be downloaded quickly using this link: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tom-sawczuk/sas_ondemand/tree/main/athlete_monitoring

### 2a - Categorical random intercepts linear mixed model
*Perform a first analysis of the data by grouping the data according to the within-participant z-score*

### 2b - Continuous random intercepts linear mixed model
*Improve the Linear Mixed Model by using a continuous covariate rather than discretising the independent variable into groups*
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4TmbPtFxN0

### 2c - Continuous random slopes linear mixed model
*Produce a random slopes mixed model, which allows variation in the influence of sleep on DWB to be considered*
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfmzNiD_WKo

### 2d - Random intercepts and random slopes recap
*Compare the three models produced so far to recap the differences between random intercepts and random slopes mixed models*
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opz8i6jKFl8

### 2e - Interpreting the models
*Interpret the outputs of the three models we have produced*
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c991Map1fbI

### 2f - Extending the model
*Extend the mixed model to include training load as a covariate, alongside sleep*
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lxmzE2x0x0

### 2g - Reframing the question
*Understand how we can manipulate the data to ask about the CHANGE in DWB, rather than the raw DWB score*
