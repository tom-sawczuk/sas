# SAS On Demand
A repository containing links to my SAS On Demand tutorials, alongside the data and scripts required for them.

## Introduction
Learn how to navigate github and how to sign up to SAS On Demand. Begin to understand the SAS environment.

## Tutorial 1 - NBA Combine data
Analyse an NBA Combine dataset using ANOVA and Mixed Models using SAS On Demand. 
All the information needed for this tutorial is in the nba_combine folder. It can be downloaded quickly using this link: https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/tom-sawczuk/sas_ondemand/tree/main/nba_combine

### 1a - Null model and One Way ANOVA
*Start analysing the data by producing a null (intercept only) model and One Way ANOVA.*

### 1b - Two Way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Model
*Incorporate two independent variables using both the Two Way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Model approaches*

### 1c - Comparing fixed and random effects
*Compare the outputs of the Two Way ANOVA and Linear Mixed Model to understand the difference between fixed and random effects*

### 1d - Interpreting the model
*Interpret the output of the Linear Mixed Model*


## Tutorial 2 - Athlete Monitoring data
Analyse an athlete monitoring dataset using Linear Mixed Models. 
All the information needed for this tutorial is in the athlete_monitoring folder. It can be downloaded quickly using this link:

### 2a - Categorical Linear Mixed Model
*Perform a first analysis of the data by grouping the data according to the within-participant z-score*

### 2b - Continuous Linear Mixed Model
*Improve the Linear Mixed Model by using a continuous covariate rather than discretising the independent variable into groups*

### 2c - Comparing random intercepts and random slopes
*Produce a random slopes mixed model, which can be compared to the random intercepts model previously created*

### 2d - Extending the model
*Add a second continuous independent variable to the model*

### 2e - Interpreting the model
*Interpret the output of the models produced so far*

### 2f - Understanding the question you're asking
*Consider the question you wish to answer and see if the model you're producing actually answers it*

### 2g - Interpreting the revised model
*Interpret the revised linear mixed model*
